					<h2>Valuing Books</h2>

	                  <aside class="text"> 
                 	   <p>
						If you possess books you wish to sell then a formal valuation the most appropriate course of action. 
						Emblem undertakes written valuations for insurance purposes or personal interest. 
						We can appraise a single book or collections. 
					  </p>
				      </aside>
						<img class="homebook" src="images/homepage/ulysses.png" alt="">  					
                      <aside class="text">  					
					<p>
						If you wish to have a book valued, a free initial verbal assessment of whether the book is likely to 
						have sufficient value to merit a full valuation is recommended. If you decide to go ahead with the valuation, 
						Emblem will provide you with an estimate of the cost before the valuation is carried out in full. Fees for valuation 
						work are charged at a half day rate of £300.

					<h2>Selling Books</h2>
					<p>
						Emblem sells rare and collectable fiction and poetry. We are particularly interested in 18th and 19th 
						century books, and have a world-renowned stock of latter 19th century women’s writing. Of particular 
						interest are first editions, private press editions, and author signed copies. We also provide a restoration 
						service, and consultancy on investment in rare books. We issue printed and illustrated catalogues of rare books 
						twice a year. We also exhibit at book fairs in the UK, New Zealand, Canada and the USA.
